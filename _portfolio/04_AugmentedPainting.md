Paintings capture both the unique vision of an artist and their refined technical expertise. While some depict real-world locations, it sometimes doesn't represent the whole place. Reproducing these works while preserving the artist's intent is a complex challenge that large-scale, generalized AI training datasets often fail to address. This project takes a more focused approach, leveraging GAN-based techniques to extend existing artworks seamlessly. By using only the original image as a guide for both style and content for the training, it offers a precise and faithful continuation of the artist's vision."
