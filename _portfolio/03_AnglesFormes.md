 [Project Website](https://grgsroussel.github.io/AnglesEtFormes/)

This project is a collaboration with the artist Emeline Mottais, focusing on the binaural sonification of her paintings. The interplay between tangible, physical spaces and virtual realms — whether digital or otherwise — captivates and intrigues us. My approach focuses on the connection between our physical bodies, which serve as the primary receptors of our environment, and our perception, which seeks to make sense of our surroundings. The combination of physical and perceptual spaces creates the illusion of reality. But what happens when these spaces dissociate? We then delve into an imaginary realm on the edge of reality. If a painting can lead us to experience a non-existent place, can a fabricated sound create the illusion of reality? <br> Binaural audio offers an accessible approach to replicating a physical sound space based on our understanding of human perception.
