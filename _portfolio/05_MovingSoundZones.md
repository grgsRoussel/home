The growing number of audio devices raises the problem of sharing the same physical space without sharing the same sound space. SoundZones make it possible to play independent and spatially separated audio programs by loudspeaker array in combination with sound fieldreproduction methods. The problem is then split into two zones: the Bright zone, where the audio content must be reproduced and theDark zone, where it must be cancelled. <br> 
Most of the available methods only deal wih static listeners. The aim of this project is to expand the method for moving listeners by reducing computational complexity.
