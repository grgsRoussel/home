Shrebrooke University -- Audace funding

Applied research topics can be tighted together to specific domain and be challenging to extract them to another one.
The main goal of this research project was to extract acoustic metamaterials research - man-made material with physics driven crafted characteristics - to their initial domain. It was proposed create acoustic metamaterials for the use in sound art installation, for it to be more accessible to people. 
Would it be possible to create both an accessible way to experience science and create laboratory outside the walls of an university?
