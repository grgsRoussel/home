Shrebrooke University -- Audace funding

Applied research topics are often deeply rooted in specific domains, making it challenging to transfer them to other fields. This research project aimed to bridge that gap by applying acoustic metamaterials—man-made materials with physics-driven properties—beyond their original domain. The goal was to create acoustic metamaterials suitable for sound art installations, making this cutting-edge technology more accessible to the public. The project explored a way to both experience science in an engaging manner and establish laboratories outside traditional university settings.
