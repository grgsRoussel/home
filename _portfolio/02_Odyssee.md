Explore the historic Orange Antique Theater through an immersive experience that blends AI-generated visuals with dynamic spatial audio. This project features a custom spatial audio system designed to engage 300 visitors in a fully immersive auditory journey throughout the theater. Each participant is equipped with a custom headset that tracks head movement and rotation, enabling them to interact with a real-time soundscape as they move through the space.
